# calculator

In this project, I worked for the first time using Ionic Capacitor to create a Calculator UI.

Some other options I aimed to work in were:
- theming, 
- hamburger menu
- calculation history

In the case of theming, there would have been a way to do it natively with Ionic had I not used the react framework. For some reason, themes are not supported with react.
Because of this, I decided not to work more on that due to time constraints.

The hamburger memu uses the reactrouter and makes accessing the calculator page and history page easily accessible.

The history page, while very simple, works as expected and could be made more visually appealing with more time.

While Capacitor is meant to make applications that can work on Android and IOS, I was only able to test and create for Android os because emulating IOS systems requires IOS hardware that I do not have at the present moment. 

To Judy and Michael:
Here is the link to the interview questions I was sent.

By the time I finished this project to the best of my current abilities, I feel that I did a good job on picking up concepts that I may not have been familiar with.
In a better structured setting that doesn't have some of the barriers I had to deal with these last few days, I feel that I can quickly become comfortable working with these tools. 
Either way, I may even continue exploring this in my own time because I found the experience valuable. I look forward to hearing back from you.

Best Wishes,
